This is sample app to fetch data from twitter and display it.
This is slightly different from my original attempt almost 2 years ago.
The original APP I had created as interview take-home question...

This version still uses ListView, I will create branch that uses recycleView.

If you want to play with this app yourself  you will need to edit the
app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml and provide various tokens & secrets for Twitter Oauth2.
